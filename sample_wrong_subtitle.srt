Hi. This is a sample srt file.

0:00:02.050 , 0:00:04.300
We will convert subtitle from

0:00:04.300 , 0:00:05.350
this type of format to some other format.

0:00:05.350 , 0:00:08.340
Basically, the "," in the above

0:00:08.340 , 0:00:09.960
timestamp file is replaced by " --> ".

0:00:09.960 , 0:00:12.610
and added subtitle index numbers before

0:00:12.610 , 0:00:13.530
the start of subtitle.

0:00:13.530 , 0:00:15.720
So if I have lots of files

0:00:15.720 , 0:00:16.600
then this process would be tiresome.

0:00:16.600 , 0:00:19.320
So I made this python file.
